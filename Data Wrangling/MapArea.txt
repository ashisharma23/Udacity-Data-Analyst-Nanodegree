Map Area

I am using the OpenStreetMap data of San Jose, CA area downloaded from
https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/san-jose_california.osm.bz2, on Jan 7, 2018.

City of San Jose, third most populous city in California and the tenth most populous in United States.
It is an economic, cultural, and political center of Silicon Valley and the largest city in Northern California.
Therefore , I find it interesting to investigate and gain more insights from this dataset.
